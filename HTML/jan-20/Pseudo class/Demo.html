	<h1 >Cricket</h1>
	<p>It lasts up to five days and two countries play against each other in this match. Next up, we have the National League Systems, also called counties in England. Their duration is for three to four days.</p>
	<p>The undying passion for cricket has many a time proved dangerous for the cricket players. Moreover, fans risk everything to display their anger or affection. Cricket unites Indians like nothing else and from kids to adults; everyone keeps track of the cricket score whenever the Indian team is playing.</p>
